# Word Tagger

This is React Tag Editor for Tagging words. You can visually check and edit the tagging of words, and receive tagged information.
When you drag the word you want to tag in Tag Editor, the tag tooltip appears at the below, and when you select the tag, the word is tagged.

## Property Structure

**tag**

    [{
	    name: string,
	    color: string(optional)
    }]

  
You have to pass the value to the TagEditor's tag property according to the above structure. If no color value is given, a random color value is automatically assigned.

**info** from onChange

    {
	    html: string,
	    tag: {
		    name: string,
		    color: string
	    },
	    word: string,
	    tagged: boolean,
	    startIndex: number,
	    endIndex: number
    }

In TagEditor's onChange event, you will receive the data with the above structure. The "html" value is from the tagged sentence. "tagged" tells whether the target word is tagged or not as a boolean value.
The "startIndex, endIndex" are still in development.
